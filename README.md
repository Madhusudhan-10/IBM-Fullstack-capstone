# IBM Full Stack Capstone Project

## Note
This repository was forked as part of the IBM course.
All implementations, modifications, and learning shown here were completed by me as part of the course requirements.

## Description
This project was completed as part of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate.
It focuses on applying full-stack development concepts in a practical way.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (Create React App)
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

**Backend**
- Django (Python)

**Database**
- SQLite (development database)

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- npm

## Project Architecture

User (Browser)
   ↓
React Frontend (UI & State Handling)
   ↓ HTTP Requests
Django Backend (APIs, Business Logic)
   ↓
SQLite Database

## My Contributions

- Worked on the frontend using React and JavaScript to build interactive UI components
- Implemented user interaction logic and state handling on the frontend
- Integrated frontend with Django backend APIs
- Worked with Django project structure, views, and routing
- Used SQLite database for storing application data during development
- Understood and worked with a full-stack project structure (frontend + backend)

## How to Run Locally

### Backend (Django)

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

### Frontend (React)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000
The backend will run on http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Key Features
- Backend development using Python and Flask
- Working with databases for data storage and retrieval
- Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Basic CRUD operations
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## What I Learned
- Structuring a full-stack application
- Connecting frontend with backend services
- Handling data using databases
- Writing cleaner and more organized code
- Understanding real-world development workflows
